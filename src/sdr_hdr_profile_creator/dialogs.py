        "inside the HDR ICC profile that Windows already has associated with your display.\n\n"
        "There are three ways to arrive at the figures it writes, and they are not equally good. "
        "Calibrate Display reads the panel's own EDID — its declared peak, sustained and black "
        "luminance, and its real primaries — and needs no judgement from you. Measure… drives a "
        "colorimeter through ArgyllCMS and replaces those declarations with what the display "
        "actually does. The sliders and the test patterns are a subjective, by-eye layer on top of "
        "either.\n\n"
        "So this is not only a by-eye tool, and it stopped being a substitute for nothing: with a "
        "meter attached it measures. What it is still not is a full colour-managed workflow — it "
        "adjusts one display's HDR profile, and does not profile your printer, your camera, or "

        "The STANDARD (SDR) association is set at exactly one moment — an HDR to SDR transition, with "
        "Automatic Mode Switching on — and only to a profile already installed on this PC: the one you "
