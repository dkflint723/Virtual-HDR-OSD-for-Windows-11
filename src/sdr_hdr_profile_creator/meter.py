"""Reading a colorimeter through ArgyllCMS's ``spotread``.

ArgyllCMS is invoked as a separate program rather than ported. That is how
DisplayCAL does it -- its tree contains no instrument code at all, only the
executable names and a subprocess call -- and it is the right arrangement here
too. Running a program is not derivative use, so Argyll's licence never reaches
this project, and Graeme Gill's maintained code does the colour matching instead
of a reimplementation of it that would be wrong in ways no test here could catch.

A wrong frame from an instrument fails loudly. A misaligned colour matching
function does not: it returns a plausible XYZ that is quietly 5-30% out, and it
would end up in a profile with no record of where it came from.

Output is consumed as it arrives rather than collected at the end. ``spotread``
with ``-O`` retries a failed read forever instead of exiting -- an i1d3 with its
ambient diffuser closed produced 46MB of the same complaint in 200 seconds -- so
waiting for the process to finish means buffering all of it and then reporting a
timeout, when the very first failure already said exactly what was wrong.
