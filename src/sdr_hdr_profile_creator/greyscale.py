"""Turning a measured greyscale ramp into the three curves MHC2 carries.

MHC2 is a matrix followed by three independent 1-D LUTs indexed by PQ code. That is a
matrix-shaper, and it decides exactly what a measurement can and cannot fix. Tone
response and grey tracking are per-code, per-channel quantities, so they are squarely
inside what the tag can express. Saturation tracking is not: no matrix-shaper represents
an error that depends on hue *and* saturation, which is why the colour sweeps this app
measures are reported and never applied.

**What is corrected, and against what.** Two separate targets, deliberately:

*Luminance* is corrected against an absolute one. A code means a luminance under
ST.2084, so the target for input code ``c`` is ``pq_eotf(c)`` and nothing about the
display enters into it. This is the whole of EOTF tracking.

*Balance* is corrected against the reference white, not against D65. The correction is
therefore zero at the reference level by construction, and what it removes is the
*drift* of grey away from that white as level changes -- which is precisely what a
multi-point control adds over a two-point one. Absolute white balance stays where it
already was, in the MHC2 matrix, so the two never fight and a second pass does not
undo the first.

**Above the measured peak nothing is corrected.** The panel is rolling off there and we
do not know how; sending it the code for its own maximum would replace whatever it does
with a hard clip. The correction is faded out to nothing between the measured peak and
code 1.0 instead, which also keeps the curve continuous. Everything here follows from
the same limit a Calman HDR10 run works under: the target is PQ up to the measured peak
and undefined above it.

The response describes the panel, not the correction on top of it -- each sample pairs
a channel's delivered luminance with the code that channel was *actually sent*, after
the LUT in force at measurement time. So a later pass replaces it rather than composing
with it, and cannot double-apply.
