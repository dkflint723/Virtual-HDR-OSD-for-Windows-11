"""Delta ITP (ITU-R BT.2124): how visible a colour error is, rather than how large.

The report currently answers with a luminance error in percent and a white drift as a
distance in xy. Two numbers, two units, and neither says the thing anyone actually wants
to know -- would you see it. A 2% luminance error at 0.5 nits and the same 2% at 500
nits are nothing like each other to the eye, and a percentage cannot express that.

dITP is defined on ICtCp (BT.2100), which is PQ-encoded and near enough perceptually
uniform across the whole HDR range, so one number covers the tone error and the
white-balance error together and means the same thing wherever on the ramp it is
measured. BT.2124 puts one just-noticeable difference at 1.0. Calibration work is
generally held to 3.0.

Deliberately self-contained: it depends only on the PQ curve, so nothing here can create
an import cycle with measure.py, which is where the measurements come from.
