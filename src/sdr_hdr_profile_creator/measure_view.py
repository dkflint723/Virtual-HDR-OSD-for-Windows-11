"""The fullscreen surface a colorimeter reads, and the run that drives it.

Deliberately separate from ``pattern_view``. That window exists to be judged by
eye: it carries guidance text, adjustable controls, markers and a guided
sequence, all of which put light on screen and all of which a meter would
integrate along with the patch. Here the screen shows one patch on black and
nothing else.

Threading is the awkward part. A reading blocks for seconds -- spotread starts a
process, opens the instrument and integrates -- and Qt must keep presenting
frames meanwhile or Windows paints the window as not responding. So the sequence
runs on a worker thread while every frame is presented on the UI thread, with the
worker blocking until each patch is actually on screen. A patch reported as shown
before it has been presented would be read mid-transition.
