"""Calibration test patterns, rendered as scRGB frames for :mod:`hdr_display`.

Every pattern is specified in **absolute nits** and encoded at render time, because what
a value means depends on the display:

* On an HDR output, scRGB is scene-referred and 1.0 is 80 nits, so a luminance maps
directly and patterns can address the full ST.2084 range.
* On an SDR output, scRGB is display-referred and 1.0 is that display's reference white.
Absolute luminance is simply not addressable, so the same pattern is rendered relative
to reference white and anything above it clips. :attr:`PatternContext.absolute` says
which of the two happened, so the UI can label a reading as real nits or as a ratio
rather than quietly implying precision it does not have.

scRGB is linear light, which matters for more than encoding: the gamma-match pattern
below relies on two interleaved lines averaging optically to their arithmetic mean, and
that is only true in a linear signal.

Rendering happens straight into a swapchain buffer sized in *device* pixels. That is not
an incidental detail -- a display at 125% scaling would resample a one-pixel line drawn
through Qt, and a resampled gamma-match pattern reports a gamma that is simply wrong.
