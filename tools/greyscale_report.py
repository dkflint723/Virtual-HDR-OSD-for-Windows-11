"""Read the meter log and say how well each run tracked what the profile asked for.

Usage:

    python tools/greyscale_report.py            # every run in the default log
    python tools/greyscale_report.py <path>     # a log kept somewhere else

Against the profile's intent, not against PQ. The two are the same only while every
control is neutral. The SDR-in-HDR correction deliberately darkens the low end -- at 0.5
nits of PQ it asks for 0.105 -- so comparing a reading against the PQ level reports that
setting as a 70% error, in exactly the part of the range someone would look at hardest.
Runs logged before the intent was recorded fall back to PQ and say so.

Two runs either side of an Apply is the test that matters: the second should track far
closer than the first, and a third should barely differ from the second. A second run
that is *worse* than the first is the signature of a correction being applied twice.

Nothing here reads the display or the profile. It only reads the log, so it can be run
long after the fact and on a different machine.
