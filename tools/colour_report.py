"""Score the colour sweeps the app already measures and has never shown anyone.

A full run reads 70 patches. Thirty of them are the saturation sweeps -- six hues at
five saturations, roughly 105 seconds of a four-minute measurement -- and the result has
never been read by anything: ``Calibration.colours`` is assigned in ``derive`` and has no
consumer anywhere in the project. The confirmation dialog meanwhile promises the user
"a saturation sweep for each colour".

**Reported, never corrected, and the distinction is the point.** MHC2 is a matrix
followed by three 1-D LUTs indexed by PQ code. An error that depends on hue and
saturation jointly has no representation in it at any LUT size, so this measures
something the profile provably cannot fix. That is worth knowing rather than hiding: it
says how far the panel departs from the additive, hue-stable behaviour a matrix-shaper
assumes, which is exactly the assumption the rest of the correction rests on.

The reference is the fork's own machinery, not an imported chart. Each patch is
predicted as an additive display: take each channel's XYZ contribution to the reference
white -- solved by ``channel_contributions``, which recovers magnitudes from the white
measured beside the primaries rather than from the primary patches themselves -- and
weight them by the drives ``_saturated`` asked for. Measured against predicted, scored in
delta ITP. So a large number here means "this panel is not additive at this hue", which
is a fact about the display, not a calibration error.
